##Goal of this app##
Right now this app is very simple. It allows you to add, remove, update
recipes that are persisted to a database. In the future I would like to
include a list of ingrdients for each recipe as well as implement
searching for a recipe by ingredient. The end goal of the app is to have
an application that allows you to input the ingredients you have on
hand, and the app will choose 5 recipes for you that you have the most
ingredients for.

##Contributions##
